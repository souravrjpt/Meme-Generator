# Meme Genarator
So, I was learning react.js (From`SCRIMBA.com`) and wanted to make a project on it.\
Here's what I ended up with, a `Meme Generator`. I learned a lot from this project and happy to deploy it on `Netlify`\
Here's the link : https://fantastic-cheesecake-521af1.netlify.app/ \
( Although, I didn't choose the domain name but its kinda align with the perspective of the project.)

## Tools, Languages, and Frameworks
I used `Vscode Ide` and `Netlify` (for deployment of my project).\
Along with this, I used `HTML, CSS, JAVASRIPT`.\
In frameworks, I used `React.js`\
( There are some cool react pakages that I encountered while doing this project:\
`react-tooltip`- use for tool tip (used to specify extra information about components when the user hovers a component)\
`react-draggable` - use for dragging any component\
`react-component-export-image` - use for exporting image as jpeg, png or pdf

## HOW TO USE
1- `Get Image` of your choice\
2- `WRITE` anything funny you want\
3- `DRAG` at your desired location\
4- `DOWNLOAD` get the meme on your PC and share it.\
Now share it with your friends!!


## FUTURE GOALS
There are many bugs in this project so I'm going to fix it one-by-one, like:\
1- The image is not responsive as we change the size of the window and same with the Download button.\
2- Haven't created 'HOW TO USE' section.\
3- I will add a section for all the memes from where you can choose the meme you want.\
4- Add a section to make a meme of your own selected image (where you can edit your own clicked images and create a meme.)

( Feel free to contribute and fix the bugs. This project is open to all)




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
